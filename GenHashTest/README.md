## Goal

Creating randomized unique string keys for filling the hash and then generating positive and negative test sets was taking a 
lot of time so I wrote this to create data files. Reading the key values from these files for experiments saves a lot of time. 
Further, Burak can also use these files for his experiments.

## Usage

See code comments. An output filename should be given as a command argument. Then, answer some questions about how many 
keys you want and what the key length should be.

## Dependencies

None
